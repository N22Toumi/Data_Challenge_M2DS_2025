    "The dataset comes from a wireless sensor network installed in a house, collecting temperature and humidity data from different rooms. It also includes weather data from a nearby airport station and recorded energy usage of lighting fixtures and appliances.\\n\",\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to develop predictive models that accurately estimate household energy consumption based on the available data. By identifying key factors that influence energy use, participants will refine their models to enhance prediction accuracy and uncover meaningful patterns.\\n\",\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and predicting energy use is key to reducing waste, cutting costs, and supporting sustainability. Better energy management helps improve home automation, use resources more efficiently, and reduce environmental impact. Insights from this challenge can lead to new ideas and solutions, helping homeowners, energy providers, and policymakers create a greener and more efficient future."
